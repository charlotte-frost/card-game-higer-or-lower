             <p> There will be a randomly generated start card. Another card 
                will be randomly generated but will not be shown to you yet 
                and  from this card you have to descide if the next card will 
                be higher or lower. If you are right, the game will continue
                and a different card from the pack qill be generated. If the 
                card is the same value as the previous one, the game will end.
                If you guess wrong, the game will end.
